In the first part of our study, we have proposed a predictive model that can accurately identify if a user is qualified to be rewarded as an Elite member in the Yelp review system, based on userâ€™s corresponding features. Accompanied with text data analysis, we aggregated our data with user ids and conducted several supervised learning algorithms, such as SVM and Decision Tree, resulted 83% of out of sample accuracy rate. 


Secondly, the other part of this work, we also executed anomaly detections, such as Gaussian Mixture and Isolation Forests. We incorporated with a subgroup of the Elite member reviews with more than 4 stars ratings, and as a novel approach, we put our focus on the usefulness and complexity aspects of the reviews by introducing the Linguistic Complexity score. We were able to detect users with suspicious high stars reviews, however, given relative less information in the overall review records.
